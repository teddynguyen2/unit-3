	<h1>Choropleth Visualization of Various Aggregate Data Types in the Autonomous Communities of Spain</h1>
	<p>Map Summary <br> <br>
	The map contains predefined geographic regions of Spain delineated by lines and varying colors, patterned in proportion to variables <br>
        such as area, median income, GDP in billions, percentage of GDP, GDP per capita, and HDI that represent an aggregate summary of <br>
        statistical data in the particular regions. The user may click on the 19 different autonomous communities of Spain to reveal and <br>
	compare the aforementioned data as it varies by geographic region. <br> <br>
	
	The choropleth map legend represents the aggregate summary of statistical data captured for the various variables such as area, median <br>
        income, GDP in billions, percentage of GDP, GDP per capita, and HDI in different color shading to delineate greater versus lesser <br>
        variable values. That is, greater values will be marked by a darker shade of color, whereas lesser values will be marked by a lighter <br>
        shade of color. <br> <br>
		
	A higher rank will be denoted by darker colors in the choropleth mapâ€™s legend. That is, greater values are marked by a darker color, <br>
	whereas lesser values are marked by a lighter color. These colors span across Spain in the 19 different autonomous communities. The <br>
	user may be able to spot, for example, the greatest human development (HDI) is in Madrid, which has a score of 0.928 (darkest shade of <br>
	green); the smallest HDI is in Melilla, which has a score of 0.841 (lightest shade of green). <br> <br>
