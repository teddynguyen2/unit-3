	<h1>Choropleth Visualization of Various Aggregate Data Types in the Autonomous Communities of Spain</h1>
	<p> <b>Map Summary</b> <br>
	The map contains predefined geographic regions of Spain delineated by lines and varying colors, patterned in proportion to variables <br>
        such as area, median income, GDP in billions, percentage of GDP, GDP per capita, and HDI that represent an aggregate summary of <br>
        statistical data in the particular regions. The user may click on the 19 different autonomous communities of Spain to reveal and <br>
	compare the aforementioned data as it varies by geographic region. <br> <br>
	
	The choropleth map legend represents the aggregate summary of statistical data captured for the various variables such as area, median <br>
        income, GDP in billions, percentage of GDP, GDP per capita, and HDI in different color shading to delineate greater versus lesser <br>
        variable values. That is, greater values will be marked by a darker shade of color, whereas lesser values will be marked by a lighter <br>
        shade of color. <br> <br>
		
	A higher rank will be denoted by darker colors in the choropleth map’s legend. That is, greater values are marked by a darker color, <br>
	whereas lesser values are marked by a lighter color. These colors span across Spain in the 19 different autonomous communities. The <br>
	user may be able to spot, for example, the greatest human development (HDI) is in Madrid, which has a score of 0.928 (darkest shade of <br>
	blue); the smallest HDI is in Melilla, which has a score of 0.841 (lightest shade of blue). <br> <br>

	<b>Main Findings</b> <br>
	Outliers & Anomalies: Ceuta and Melilla are the smallest in terms of area, with an area of 19 and 12 km² respectively. These two cities are <br>
	also the smallest in terms of GDP, yet their GDP per capita is roughly equivalent to the cluster of all other autonomous regions in Spain. <br> <br>
	
	Patterns/Trends/Correlations: All autonomous communities do not differ greatly in the median income, GDP per capita, and HDI; however, they <br>
	all vary drastically in the total GDP and percentage. One other big difference is that the sizes of the regions vary greatly. There is no <br>
	correlation between the size of the autonomous community and its median income, GDP, or even HDI. Regions that generated greater amounts <br>
	of revenue tended to be closer to the sea, i.e., Balearic Sea or Mediterranean Sea.  <br> <br>
	
	Clusters: Most data clusters near each other, as mentioned in the patterns. The aggregate data cannot be reasonably assumed to correlate with <br>
	one another. That is to say, one variable does not correlate with another with statistical significance in this map. <br> <br> <br>
